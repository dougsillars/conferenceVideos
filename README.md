# ConferenceVideo Creator


With the websites in this reporsitory, you can create high quality conference videos for for distribution.  Use these for your next online conference, or use them to post-process the videos from your live event for later distribution.  The videos are then available on Cloudinary - allowing you to host them on your conference website.

## The Process

### Build the Layout

The layout describes how you will arrange the video of the speaker and the slides on your custom backdrop.  You'll probably only needto do this once per conferece (keeping a similar layout across all talks).

1. Create the layout of your conference talk.  To do this, you'll need your conference "backdrop", and 2 sample images: a presenter and a sample slide uploaded to your Cloudinary Cloud.


### Process a video

1. Record a video of the speaker and a screen capture of the slides at the same time.  IN the examples below, I simply used my cell phone to record my video, and I used QuickTime on my Mac for the screen recording.

2. Upload these videos to Cloudinary.  NOTE: These files are likely very large, you will want to have the maximum upload size increased on your account to do this.

 a. If you wish to have captions, upload one of the videos with the appropriate Cloudinary add-on for captions.
